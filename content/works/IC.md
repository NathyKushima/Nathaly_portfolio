## Implementation of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) using Petri Net and Raspberry Pi  

- Conducted research on the functioning of Petri Net, a modeling language for discrete distributed systems, in industrial labs at the Mechatronics Department of POLI.
- Studied and implemented Raspberry Pi as an information receiver and processor.
- Programmed in the PIPE application for modeling a generic Petri Net.
- Developed and implemented an interactive visual interface for controlling the logic controller after inserting a Petri Net.
